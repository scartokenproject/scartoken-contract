The chain was launched with an initial 20 trillion tokens, 4 trillion was immediately burnt to kick-start “Scar” Token’s deflationary tokenomics. 2.00% of every transaction (buy, sell, or transfer) is taxed and distributed between all “Scar” Token addresses on that particular chain. 
3% of this tax is sent to the iquidity pool and locked for ever. 
That system will be incentivizing holders to hold, decreasing the circulating supply over time, and help feed every human.
These rewards are earned immediately and automatically into holders’ wallets. 
Simple tokenomics and elegant design and production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project.
100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible. 
#SCAR TOKEN join us on our journey to feed every hungry.
